1. Get the args.
2. Init stack a and check for non maths related chars and if the length of the arg is empty.
3. Convert the arg with ft_atol to a long and check for duplicates or overflows.
4. Append the node and move forward.
5. Check if stack is sorted already if not then check if the length of the stack is 2, if yes then we swap the first 2 elements of a meaning it will be sorted.
	If its 3 then we sort three.
