Target Node: Every node gets a target node in a to b
	"Smallest bigger" = The smallest number in the stack that is bigger than itself.
	if the current A value is bigger than the current B value and the current A value is smaller than the best match index:
		set new bmi
	
Example stack: 0 3 6 8 10 15

Context number 1: 7

Context number 2: 16

Context number 2: -1

The case for stack A -> B:
The smallest bigger in that stack for 7 would be 8 making it its best match index number and set the target node as the node with the value of 8.
The is no smallest bigger in that stack for 16 so we set the best match index to LONG_MIN and set the target node as the smallest node.

The case for stack B -> A:
Instead of setting the best match index to LONG_MIN we set it to LONG_MAX

Steps:

Split the args if needed

Init stack A and check for errors

Check if the stack is sorted and if it has either two values or three

swap A once if its two numbers

tiny sort on stack A if its three

tiny sort:
	get the biggest value in stack A and store it

	if the stored node is the same as the current A node:
		rotate A 
	if the current nodes next node is the same as the stored node:
		reverse rotate A 
	if the value of the current node is bigger than the next value:
		swap A

do the "turk" sorter if its more than three

TURK:

get the length of stack a

Push the first two nodes of stack A to stack B if the length of stack A is more than three and stack A is not sorted

while the length of stack A is still more than three and stack A is not sorted
	init nodes A:
		set the positions / indexs of stack A and stack B
		calculate the targets / bmi for each node in stack A
		calculate the cost of how many steps it will take for each node to be moved to the top
		find the node in stack A with the least amount of steps to be pushed to the top and set the is_cheapest flag to true
	
	move A to B:
		find the cheapest node of stack A and store it for use
		
		check if the cheapest node is above the middle of the stack and if the cheapest nodes target is also above the middle:
			if so rotate both of that at the same time until either the cheapest node or the target node is at the top its stack
				update the positions of each node in both stack A and B after rotation
		
		if neither of them are above the middle of the stack:
			reverse rotate both if them at the same time
		
		correct the rotations of the cheapest node and its target if needed, putting them both at the top of each stack
		push the top node of A to B

three nodes remain in stack A so we do a tiny sort on stack A

while stack B is not empty
	init nodes B:
		update the positions of each node in both stack A and B
		set target nodes from B to A
	
	move B to A:
		correct the rotations of each target node of A in B to bring the target to the top of b
		push the top node of B to A

set the positions of only stack A as stack B is empty

while the current value of the stack A node is not the smallest value in A:
	if the smallest value in A is above the middle of the stack:
		rotate A
	
	if that is not the case:
		reverse rotate A

clear up memory and exit
